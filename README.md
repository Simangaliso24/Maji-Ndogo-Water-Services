# Maji Ndogo Water Services Analysis üíß

---

## **Project Overview** üìù

This project analyzes water services data in **Maji Ndogo** to identify infrastructure issues, water contamination, and instances of corruption. The goal is to transform raw data into **actionable insights** that guide engineers and decision-makers in improving water access for the community.

---

## **Database & Tools** üõ†Ô∏è

- **Database Name:** `md_water_services`  
- **Tools:** MySQL / PostgreSQL (any SQL engine that supports standard SQL)  
- **Techniques:**  
  - Joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`)  
  - Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  
  - Views  
  - Aggregations and percentages  
  - Conditional logic with `CASE` statements  

---

## **How to Run** ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

1. **Restore the Database:**  
   - Extract `database.zip` and restore `md_water_services` to your SQL server.  

2. **Run Queries:**  
   - Open `project.sql` in your SQL client.  
   - Ensure the database is selected:  
     ```sql
     USE md_water_services;
     ```  
   - Run queries in order; they are commented to explain each step.  

3. **Check Outputs:**  
   - Aggregated tables and views summarize water access, broken taps, and well contamination.  
   - The `Project_progress` table provides actionable steps for engineers.

## **Key Steps in the Analysis** üìä

1. **Joining Tables:**  
   - `visits` + `location` + `water_source` to combine data on water sources and their locations.  
   - `LEFT JOIN` with `well_pollution` to include well contamination results.  

2. **Building the Combined View:**  
   - `combined_analysis_table` simplifies repeated analysis by consolidating all relevant columns.  

3. **Aggregations:**  
   - Province-level analysis with `province_totals`.  
   - Town-level analysis with `town_aggregated_water_access`.  

4. **Actionable Insights:**  
   - Identify towns with high percentages of broken taps.  
   - Detect wells contaminated with chemical or biological agents.  
   - Calculate the population served by each type of water source per town/province.  

5. **Project Progress Tracking:**  
   - `Project_progress` table stores tasks for engineers, including repairs, improvements, and status tracking.

## **Key Insights** üìà

- Percentage of households using rivers, shared taps, taps in home, broken taps, and wells.  
- Towns with the highest number of broken taps or long queues.  
- Wells that require filtration due to contamination.  
- Data-driven decisions to **address corruption** and improve water access.

## **Conclusion** ‚úÖ

This project demonstrates the power of **SQL for real-world data analysis**. By joining multiple tables, aggregating data, and applying conditional logic, we transformed raw data into meaningful insights. The resulting tables provide a clear roadmap for engineers and decision-makers to take action, improving water services and addressing corruption in Maji Ndogo.
